\section{EXPERIENCE}

\employer{The Trade Desk}
\location{Boulder CO}
\dates{5/17-8/17}
\title{\textbf{Front-End Performance Work}}
\begin{position}
At the trade desk I worked on their embedded pixel for customers sites, ensuring reasonably fast load times regardless of partner server outages. This work required extreme attention to edge case handling, as most of the errors my code resolved stemmed from rare conflicts with parter servers.
\end{position}

\employer{Rapha}
\location{Boulder CO}
\dates{03/17-11/17}
\title{\textbf{Barista}}
\begin{position}
While at Rapha I further developed my customer service abilities and made use of my attention to detail in providing great service. I helped to assemble the shop and create the friendly, well catered atmosphere that the clubhouse is meant to have. 
\end{position}

\employer{Toys2Life}
\location{Boulder CO}
\dates{10/16-6/17}
\title{\textbf{BLE and Language Model development}}
\begin{position}
I spent time working on an existing C\# code base. This involved significant re-factoring and creation of new functionality, while cleaning up the codebase for better readability. The product involves custom firmware for the BLE stack, leveraged to gather relative location data of discrete nodes. On top of this I developed language models to give nodes the ability to have contextually driven conversations with each other. I also developed a graphical UI for internal content creation, this was also in C\#.
\end{position}

\employer{Lab for Atmospheric and Space Physics}
\location{Boulder CO}
\dates{02/15-10/16}
\title{\textbf{IT Administrator}}
\begin{position}
I worked to manage the in-house servers and maintain user access. This included regular backups, building new servers, migrating data between hardware, and interaction with a large VMware stack. The server-room housed racks for both database storage/access and computation. We had a diverse customer base with disparate needs, requiring us to be flexible and accurate in providing for the customers.

\section{MOTIVATION}
Since I began commuting to high-school on my first road bike, a Specialized TriCross, cycling has helped me to maintain both physical and mental composure. It has been a  common thread through the last 8 years of my life while my other hobbies, my city of residence, and my many occupations changed. The friends I've made through the sport, the satisfaction of thorough home maintenance, the meditative nature of a solo-ride up sunshine canyon: these are the things I think back to and smile about. While developing a passion for Mathematics and working as a computer scientist, I have developed an associated attention to detail. I would love to further engage myself in the cycling community, and a role at Mosaic would be a great fit; I would be able to make use of both my passion for bikes and attention to detail in helping to create amazing products.
